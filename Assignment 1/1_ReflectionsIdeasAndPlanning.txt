I feel like a solution for this problem is a simple drawing app thats combined with google maps. 
You draw a rough estimate of a trail you want to go and how far you want to go and the app transforms it into a route that you can follow.

I feel like having a paid version of an app with no ads and a free version with packages is the simplest way to solve the compensation problem.
When you have an app that only allows entrance with payment you shrink the potential list of customers that you can have. 
In the case that you have a free app with packages you get to have your cake and eat it too. 
For example the free app can only use a scanner app once an hour but if you pay for the super edition you get unlimited uses. 
I think the tesla home page has an amazingly sleek and clear ui/ux. When you first arrive at the page you are introduced with a nice picture of the first product in the list. 
You are also presented with all the products available so there is no looking around for the product you want. 
As you scroll down you are showered with nice animation and pictures of the inside of the car and its parts. 

Although my idea has not changed, which is an app that displays an embedded ikea video for each product. 
Having these discussions made me think more and more about functionality and ask more questions about the purpose of the app.
